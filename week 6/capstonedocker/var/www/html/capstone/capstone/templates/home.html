            <p>"Travel sites can be very expensive if you don’t know how to work your way around. I tried to book a flight with CheapOair and they didn’t even bother to tell me that the flight I booked have increased its price. So I went to Travelocity and I manually booked connecting flights rather than booking a fixed connecting flights. You can save money this way. After booking, I received my itinerary right away from the airline and I saved a lot of money."</p>
